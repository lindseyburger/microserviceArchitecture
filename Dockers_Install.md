I began by installing Dockers, and then following the tutorial to create a container and run an image.

I clicked on the button that added the commands to the built in terminal, and ran the commands. 
Next, I used the command in the terminal to build an image.

Then, I used the commands and terminal to run the container.

Then, I set up an account on Dockers to be able to share and save my image.

I was a little confused on what to do next because I never used Dockers before, so I navigated to my images tab to see if what I created was there.

I then ran a new container from that image.
