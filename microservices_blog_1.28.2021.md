Microservices Gartner Report

I found the Gartner Microservice report to be really interesting and informational. I liked how the
blog began by stating the 3 main goals of microservice architecture; development agility, deployment
flexibility, and precise scalability, and then also went into great detail explaining each goal. What 
I personally gathered from this report is that microservice architecture is a fantastic tool to use with
competitive services that need to constantly update, add new features, and add new capabilities. Microservices
allows this to happen essentially seemlessly, since things are broken down into small components, which also 
allows developers to understand where exactly a fault occurs (quicker fix time). As I read this report, I wondered
if it makes sense for smaller companies to also use microservice architecture, since they're probably not dealing
with high traffic volumes, major competition and quick delivery of new features that companies like Twitter/Netflix
deal with, but the report states that even though they may not deal with the issues the large companies face,
they still need to be able to continously deliver to the client/customers. Anything with tech needs to be updated
somewhat frequently (otherwise it gets outdated quickly), so the CD software delivery mindset makes sense to use
with microservice architecture. 

I also liked how the blog explained the difference in granularities between Microservices, Miniservices and Macroservices.
I think last class we really drove home the great features of microservices, so I was left wondering why any company wouldn't
use this architecture, so it was interesting to see the pros/cons and usages of each service granularity. One sentence
that stood out to me was "When building a new application, you should implement most capabilities as coarse-grained miniservices,
unless you have a compelling arcitectural reason to adopt coarser- or finer-grained granularity. When rearchitecting an existing
application, leave functionality in the monolith until you have a reason to refactor it into a seperately deployable component. It was
also very interesting to see how the 3 different services can work together. I really liked the diagram shown on page 7
that displays the different usages on an E-commerce application user interface; macroservices for shipping, miniservices for
cart and check-out, and microservices for product display. 

I also really liked the diagram found on page 16 of how one should go about deploying a microservice. From last class, I was
a little confused as to how companies like Netflix would even start to go about breaking down everything, but as the diagram states,
you start from a monolithic tier, and then continously break down into finer grained capabilites. A company would start out by using
microservices, they would break down features as needed. I also liked how at the end of the report, there was a list of different supplier
of MSA tools, frameworks, libraries and management technologies. Many of these are quite new (AWS), so it's interesting to see how an 
immature infrastucture is being used by major corporations (and the different ways they employ it).
