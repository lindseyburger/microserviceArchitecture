My selection for the Microservices case study is option #4: Rabobank migration to microservices. I was interested in this option because after I graduate
I am going to be working for PNC's Technology Development Program, and I think it would be fascinating to compare Rabobank's technology architecture with PNC's.
It's also interesting to learn about how banks are moving to cloud based technologies and I could potentially be a part of PNC's migration (if they chose to
eventually do that as well). Learning about this case study could give me a potential edge as an employee of PNC as well. It's also more interesting when you
learn about things that are relevant to your life, and Rabobank definitely has a relevance to my future job.
