Overall, I thought this presentation was really interesting because we were able to see first-hand how the ideas and tools that we discuss in class work in real life scenarios. For example, Adrian went into detail about how microservices are important since developers  always need to change and update their code, which is an idea we’ve discussed at length in class. I liked how he annotated a lot during the presentation to help us better comprehend these ideas. Another thing I really liked about the presentation was how Adrian showed us the anatomy of Filbo, and went into detail about how all of the objects, classes, etc. link and work together. That definitely helped me to understand what is being done where (example: logic is implemented in the service classes). Like I said before, being able to have a real life example helps a lot to grasp these concepts. One thing that was really interesting to me was when Adrian said that you should never do your own security. That was something I hadn’t thought of, and I didn’t know how things were secured with API’s. Being able to listen and also ask questions to Adrian was really awesome, and it definitely helped to give a better understanding of microservices.
